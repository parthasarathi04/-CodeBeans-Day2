# Ancient Bangalore Circus
Circuses around the world now are defined in their size and shape. They ought to be 13 meters in diameter. But this was not the case before. Read on. 

In those good old days, circus arenas had the shapes of regular isometric polygons. The size and the number of corners were left to the choice of the owners and had no standard rule. However what was common between all the circuses were how they were built. Each corner of the arena had special posts put up, and ropes were stretched between the posts to mark the edges of the arena. That is how they were identified. 

As time went on, these arenas changed and redefined themselves and all was forgotten. 

Until recently, scientists from Bangalore discovered the remains of something that looked like an ancient circus arena. However, only three pillars have been found and the remaining pillars had been destroyed beyond find.

# Problem statement : 
You are given the coordinates of these three pillars. Find out what is the smallest area that the arena could have.
